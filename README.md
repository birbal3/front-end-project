# Front-End Project

This project is a front-end application developed using ReactJS and JavaScript, based on a Figma design.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **public/**: Contains static assets and the main HTML file.
- **src/**: Contains the React components and main application logic.
- **eslint.config.js**: Configuration file for ESLint to maintain code quality.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file.
- **package-lock.json**: Automatically generated file that describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.
- **postcss.config.js**: Configuration file for PostCSS.
- **tailwind.config.js**: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
